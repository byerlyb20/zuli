This project intends to reconstruct and document the protocol used to interact with Zuli smartplugs,
additionally providing a Python utility that implements this protocol. This project is mostly driven
by curiosity, though it is published with the hope that someone might find realistic use out of the
work that I have done.

## About Zuli smartplugs

Zuli smartplugs were announced
on Kickstarter in 2015 with an iOS app announced at launch and an Android app promised shortly
thereafter. The company has recently discontinued support for both apps, though it is still possible
to use their smartplugs since they operate locally using Bluetooth.
